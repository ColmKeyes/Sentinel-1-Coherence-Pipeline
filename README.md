# Sentinel-1-Coherence-Pipeline
MSc Sentinel-1 Coherence Processing &amp; Analysis pipeline, using Snappy, Rasterio &amp; Xarray.



<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<!-- 
Coherence remains an underdeveloped InSAR product when it comes to forest monitoring applications.
Plenty of examples of the use of backscatter in production can be found, see the Global Forest Watch initiative.  
However, there lacks an implementation of coherence in these already existing backscatter monitoring systems.
Coherence can be an affective supplimental data source for backscatter based systems. 

Here, I present a pipeline for processing Sentinel-1 SLC data to produce Xarray data-cubes containing both coherence and 
backscatter time series.
